it is 10:15 which means you should be asleep\

i wasn't kidding about wanting to blog though. idk if it really counts as a blog if it's just random ramblings that i know only you will see???
is this weird as hell? idk if our friendship is at stream-of-consciousness blogging to you level yet (i don't see why not)\

i hope you're able to find this, it feels like a secret message, a secret way of communication. kind of fucking poetic to me but it's too late for me to be having normal person thoughts. everything is poetic.\

i hope you're having good dreams right now. i actually don't know if you ever dream (or remember them, i guesss.) i should ask you.\
